# Top 10 most interesing Links of Week 08

1. [tldrlfs](https://github.com/comfies/tldrlfs)<br>
Too Long; Didn't Read Linux From Scratch. This link contains a guide that  will teach you to build a working operating system that uses the Linux kernel in much fewer commands than LFS. It will take a much smaller amount of time, copious amounts of alcohol if you're so inclined, and plenty of cursing. When i joked about "Hey, is there a lfs speedrun? lol" and then i searched on google and then i found this! and also a video compiling LFS speedrun. Shared it with my friends (im sure they going to put it in their top 10 aswell haha), i feel satisfied.

2. [Compiling LinuxFromScratch - "Speedrun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loyi9htuXVM)<br>
from what i experienced so far this week making LFS, it basically just copy pasting commands with some tweaks here and there, so it is not improbable that there's a LFS speedrun. Unlike other speedruns like [Arch Linux Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8utpbbdj0LQ) which takes 1.5 Minute Average, LFS kinda took a long time because of alot of different factors.There's an attempt...

3. [Bored? How about trying a Linux speed run?](https://lobste.rs/s/mwrois/bored_how_about_trying_linux_speed_run)<br>
This is the place where i found out about LFS speedrun when i first searched it. It gave me a link to the github page (refer to link #1). Other than that, people provide their stories about their experience building LFS.

4. [CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free during this time. In multi programming systems, one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling. this link conrains a summary about CPU scheduling.

5. [Round Robin Scheduling with different arrival times](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/round-robin-scheduling-with-different-arrival-times/)<br>
Round-robin scheduling algorithm is used to schedule process fairly each job a time slot or quantum and the interrupting the job if it is not completed by then the job come after the other job which is arrived in the quantum time that makes these scheduling fairly.

6. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
This link contains informations about Preemptive and non preemptive scheduling and the algorithim based on it. Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. And Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state.

7. [Real Time Scheduling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs111/supp/realtime)<br>
A real-time system is one whose correctness depends on timing as well as functionality. Linux was not designed to be an embedded or real-time operating system, but many tasks that were once-considered embedded applications now require the capabilities (e.g. file systems, network protocols) of a general purpose operating system. As these requirements have increased and processors have gotten faster, increasingly many embedded and real-time applications have moved to Linux. To support these applications Linux now supports a real-time scheduler, which can be enabled with sched_setscheduler(2), and is described in this Linux Journal Article. This real-time scheduler does not provide quite the same level of response-time guarantees that more traditional Real-Time-OSs do, but they are adequate for many soft real-time applications. This link contains an explanation about realtime scheduling and it's algorithims.

8. [Completely Fair Scheduler](https://www.linuxjournal.com/node/10267)<br>
Most modern operating systems are designed to try to extract optimal performance from underlying hardware resources. This is achieved mainly by virtualization of the two main hardware resources: CPU and memory. Modern operating systems provide a multitasking environment that essentially gives each task its own virtual CPU. The task generally is unaware of the fact that it does not have exclusive use of the CPU. Like most modern operating systems, Linux is a multitasking operating system, and therefore, it has a scheduler. The Linux scheduler has evolved over time.

9. [What is NUMA (non-uniform memory access)?](http://www.techplayon.com/what-is-numa-non-uniform-memory-access/)<br>
This era of data centric processing with huge requirement of speed between CPU and memory, gave birth to a new architecture called Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) or more correctly Cache-Coherent Numa (ccNUMA). In this architecture each processor has a local bank of memory, to which it has a much closer (lower latency) access. this link explains what is NUMA and a summary on how it works.

10. [Big O Notation Explained with Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-explained-with-examples/)<br>
We already learned a lot about Big O notation from our Data Structures and Algorithim class.Big O notation is a way to describe the speed or complexity of a given algorithm. If your current project demands a predefined algorithm, it's important to understand how fast or slow it is compared to other options. This time we ae gonna review Big O notation and how it works through this link.
