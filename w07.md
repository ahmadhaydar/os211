# Top 10 most interesing Links of Week 07

1. [Deadlock Introduction in Operating System](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/deadlock-introduction/)<br>
Deadlock refers to the condition when 2 or more processes are waiting for each other to release a resource indefinitely. A process in nature requests a resource first and uses it and finally releases it. This link contains a series of articles that introduces Deaclock, it's detection and recovery, and lastly Prevention and Avoidance.

2. [Semaphores in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Semaphores are integer variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal that are used for process synchronization. We finised a problem on quiz based on this topic. the use in linux is a bit different.

3. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.faceprep.in/operating-systems/operating-system-bankers-algorithm/)<br>
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. This article elaborate how the Banker's Algorithim is implemented in Data Structure.

4. [Peterson’s Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/peterson-s-problem)<br>
Peterson’s solution provides a good algorithmic description of solving the critical-section problem and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the requirements of mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting. What i like about this link, is that it tells me the disadvantages of the solution.

5. [Critical Region in Process Synchronization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKKc0d7kzww)<br>
this link explains about process synchronizaiton in 5 minutes. it contains a video that explains about the critical region in process synchronization with real time example.

6. [Deadlock vs Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br>
this Article explains about the Difference between Deadlock and Starvation in OS. From how the process works, how it's affecting the resources, Conditions, and how to prevent them. In summary Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and wait for other resource held by any other process while Starvation is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time.

7. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
this link contains an article covering the concept of Process synchronization in an Operating System. Process Synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process executions.

8. [What is a race Condition?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition)<br>
When writing multithreaded applications, one of the most common problems experienced is race conditions. The guy in the link is just as confused as i do, but the question gets answered very satisfyingly and i love that.

9. [Sleeping Barber problem in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sleeping-barber-problem-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
This link contains a very popular problem discussed within process synchronization. The analogy (of the sleeping barber problem) is based upon a hypothetical barber shop with one barber. There is a barber shop which has one barber, one barber chair, and n chairs for waiting for customers if there are any to sit on the chair.

10. [How to use POSIX semaphores in C language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/)
On article number 2, i explained that the use of semaphore in linux has it's own thing. The POSIX system in Linux presents its own built-in semaphore library. This link explains how to use POSIX semaphores in C.
