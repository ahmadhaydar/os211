# Top 10 most interesing Links of Week 06

1. [Concurrency Reading](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/)<br>
Concurrency means multiple computations are happening at the same time. when i try to learn more about concurrency this popped up first, and i kinda see why. it's from a reputable source, and it's sums up what i wanted to learn pretty nicely. What's interesting thing is, it gives me some useful knowledge about other courses aswell, like advanced programming because concurrency is essential for that.

2. [CodeVault: Background and Foreground Processes(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ud2iqu9szk)<br>
This link contains a video that explains background and foreground processes and demonstrates them on C for our understanding. Just like what we did in the synchronous class, he demonstrate and explains to us about it.

3. [Android Runtime (ART) and Dalvik](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik)<br>
This is an official documentation of the android source about ART and Dalvik. Android runtime (ART) is the managed runtime used by applications and some system services on Android. ART and its predecessor Dalvik were originally created specifically for the Android project. ART as the runtime executes the Dalvik Executable format and Dex bytecode specification.

4. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)<br>
Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). This link contains a demonstration on how fork() actually works like in C.

5. [fork() Child and Parent Processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7265718/fork-child-and-parent-processes)<br>
At the last quiz, i searched about PIDs of processes and uses fork(). this is how i found out the answer for the last question. And i say "Wow, thats pretty simple!".

6. [Kernel vs User Thread](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=processes-kernel-threads-user-threads)<br>
A kernel thread is a kernel entity, like processes and interrupt handlers; it is the entity handled by the system scheduler. A kernel thread runs within a process, but can be referenced by any other thread in the system. A user thread is an entity used by programmers to handle multiple flows of controls within a program. This documentation by IBM explains everything about that and andditionally helps with Understanding threads and processes in general.

7. [A Brief View About Concurrency vs Parallelism](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
When i was doing quiz last week, it struck me on how hard it is to differentiate between concurrency and parralelism. and this interesting article helps me understand it in a language that is easy for me to understand. Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time (concurrently). Parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple CPUs at the exact same time.

8. [Learn Makefiles With the tastiest examples](https://makefiletutorial.com/)<br>
Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. This helps me understand how makefiles work and how to use it because it gives me an example.

9. [Difference between fork() and exec()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-fork-exec/)<br>
Every application(program) comes into execution through means of process, process is a running instance of a program. Processes are created through different system calls, most popular are fork() and exec(). this link explains the differences between fork() and exec().

10. [Process Identification](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Process-Identification)<br>
Each process is named by a process ID number, a value of type pid_t. A process ID is allocated to each process when it is created. Process IDs are reused over time. The lifetime of a process ends when the parent process of the corresponding process waits on the process ID after the process has terminated. this link explains Process identification in The GNU C Library.
