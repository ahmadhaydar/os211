# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File Systems As Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV0-EPUYuQc)<br>
Because i don't really like learning things by just reading(i like things like writing), i like learning things as fast as possible without filling too much info in my head. Before i learn File system interface i need to learn what file systems is. this link contains a youtube video from one of my favorite channel that will explain file systems as fast as possible. Short enough for your attention span but not too fast to the point of you not understanding what it is.

2. [That one meme where people get told to delete their system 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-mrgCN4APs)<br>
The system32 directory contains Windows system files and software program files,it's where the files needed to be run for windows to operate. Similar to the other old joke, people got trolled by hitting alt+f4 to fix the problems their programs but turns out it's just ending the process. Deleting system32 is much worse. This link contains a video that would explain and show what would happen if you force delete system32 in a windows 10 operating system.

3. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
When i transitioned from windows to linux, i am super confused as how different the file system/structure would be. for example, when i installed a file where did it go? how do i make a shortcut and stuff? and where the hecc is the program files man i just want to delete some shizz!? wll this link contains a video that will explain that.

4. [Linux Demo: Creating a File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZBvdqRAdus)<br>
This link explains how you can create your own file system . This will walk you throuch on how you create a file system step by step from start to finish.

5. [Linux File permissions and Ownership Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1yzI7c6Fzk)<br>
This link will help you understand how Linux file permissions and ownership works. I use this videos to find out how can i manage some files that i can't diddle when i received it.

6. [How a ransomware can encrypt all your files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agFgibQydzg)<br>
This link contains a youtube video that will explain how a ransomware can encrypt all your important files within your file system. Specifically the ransomware in question is the infamous WannaCry. I am kind of intrigued in this topic as i have dealt with ransomware on my device before, other than  messing up your important files to a nonsense degree, it also manipulates your desktop and file names and whenever you opened any file it will direct you to a page to decrypt your files (and you know that is a big bluff and the ransomware makers sits in a throne of lies), forcing me to reset my computer and fix my hardware to it's default state, losing all of my files in the process.

7. [The Top 28 Fuse Filesystem Open Source Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/fuse-filesystem)<br>
the title says it all. it contains 28 fuse filesystem open source projects that were made for specific purposes. from Goofys, a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3 file system written in Go. to Rar2fs FUSE file system for reading RAR archives.

8. [Remote Access Trojan](https://www.howtogeek.com/410634/what-is-rat-malware-and-why-is-it-so-dangerous/)<br>
this link explains about Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which is  is a type of malware that includes and administrative control over the target computer remotely. it gives the user administrative control over deleting, downloading and even altering their files and file systems. I had a bad experience with it, the scariest part that it can turn on your webcam without you noticing and sometimes control your mouse movement without any prior notification. it is scary as heck and it sure does makes me think that there's a ghost possessing my system haha...

9. [Introduction to Remote File Systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/introduction-to-remote-file-systems#:~:text=Remote%20file%20systems%20enable%20an,accessible%20from%20a%20client%20computer.)<br>
this link contains an article about what an RFS is and what is it for. Remote file systems (RFS) enable an application that runs on a client computer to access files stored on a different computer. Remote file systems also often make other resources (remote printers, for example) accessible from a client computer. this seems interesting because this one makes me think of that RAT i elaborate about in the previous link.

10. [UltraISO](https://www.ultraiso.com/)<br>
UltraISO is an application for Microsoft Windows for creating, modifying and converting ISO image files used for optical disc authoring. i used it to open ISO files and make partitions to make it seems that my device is having a physical disk that contains the file inside ISO file to make some programs or installation works correctly.
