# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Quick Summary of C pointers for lazy readers](https://www.zentut.com/c-tutorial/c-pointer/)<br>
From years, and years of studying and learning anything. one of the things i know about myself is that i am a really lazy reader. I like to find some info and summarize it to learn the idea of what i want to know. which right now its C pointers. Once i know about it in a nutshell, it would be easy to GSGS and process the information since i understand the big circle. So here's the summary of C pointers.

2. [Wine Is Not an Emulator](https://www.winehq.org/)<br>
Wine is basically my only way of running windows programs on my linux, as linux doesnt support windows file format and windows libraries, it needs something to interpret windows' programs and uses them on linux.Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.

3. [malloc() and calloc() in C](https://www.journaldev.com/35650/malloc-and-calloc-in-c)<br>
malloc() is used to allocate a user-defined number of bytes on the heap. calloc() is similar, but it not only allocates memory but sets them to zero. this link contains a tutorial how to use malloc() and calloc() to dynamically manage static memory, along with using realloc() and free() functions.

4. [Disk Defragmentation Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRIOUZuI2c)<br>
this link explains about disk defragmentation. it contains an animated video explaining what is defragmention or doing a defrag on your hard drive. Defragging your hard drive will speed up your computer. How to make your computer faster? Do SSDs have to be defragged?

5. [Endianness Explained With an Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>
This link provides an easy explanation of endianness explained with an egg. from byte orderinf and boiled egg orientation. Dr Steve Bagle explains the topic named after something from an 18th century novel

7. [Memory Management 101](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MM-101-Introduction-to-Linux-Memory-Management-Christoph-Lameter-Jump-Trading-LLC.pdf)<br>
this link explains in points about memory management on linux.  The basics of paging. Understanding basic hardware memory management and the difference between virtual, physical and swap memory. How do determine hardware installed and how to figure out how processes use that memory. How a process uses physical and virtual memory effectively.How to control overcommit and virtual and/or physical memory limits.

8. [Paging File or Pagefile as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br>
A paging file is an overflow for your RAM or system memory. This contains a videothat explains what that means and how to optimize it.

9. [HOWTO: Shared Libraries](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html)<br>
Shared libraries are libraries that are loaded by programs when they start. When a shared library is installed properly, all programs that start afterwards automatically use the new shared library. this link explains its conventions and how it is used.

10. [Variable Scope in C](https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/variable-scope/)<br>
A scope is a region of the program, and the scope of variables refers to the area of the program where the variables can be accessed after its declaration. this link explains how to use variable scopes in C, like global variables and local variables.
