1. [Ten](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The site i use to learn about vi hands on. vi is the default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system.

2. [Nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XtNXutVto)<br>
Learning about Vim using Luke Smith's video. from movements to something that i don't even know vim has, like spellchecker!

3. [Eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iox7fr7p5Hc)<br>
this video is when i try to find out which one's the right distribution to use for personal uses. I still use debian for this course though.

4. [Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRZvwBevctA)<br>
At the time i try to look about awk commands in linux. this was after i finished the quiz, even though my QUIZ CODE IS WRONG!!!!

5. [Six](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/400650/counting-the-characters-of-each-line-with-wc)<br>
i found this when i wanted to find the answer to the popquiz. and hey its wc but at the time i didn't use it.

6. [Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TYr1mCzMcg)<br>
when the lecturer sent the video to discord, i'm intrigued as to what's it about. and its an introduction to build your own Linux operating system from source files using the Linux From Scratch book.

7. [Four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtdYBc3p5Kw)<br>
i heard that one of my friends, before OS already used linux. it was called arch linux and i was like hey it looked kinda difficult compared to other distros i have seen. And in OS we used debian so i wondered what's the difference between then and why should i use this distro.

8. [Three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZrvpxxRrgA)<br>
Before OS begins i use Ubuntu (and Windows 10) as my main OS basically because ubuntu is simply faster and well known by me at the time. I acknowledge that Ubuntu is debian based but i don't know what makes it different so i watch this video.

9. [Two](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html)<br>
I was told to know more about Linux's Regular Expressions(Regex) which are special characters which help search data and matching complex patterns. this is what i need to know as a starting point to study other stuff other than bash.

10. [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORcvSkgdA58)<br>
We know that we uses SSH as a means to use my virtual machine but i don't know why do i use it and how it works. So i found this video about how SSH works by Computerphile
