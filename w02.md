# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [repl.it(An online IDE)](repl.it)<br>
this is the website i used to experiment and write code in C since i want to start coding in C ASAP. This is an in-browser IDE that supports 50+ languages. As a plus, replit also support collaborations.

2. [C implementation for ROT13](https://repl.it/@ahmadhaydar/TrainingGrounds#main.c)<br>
My implementation of ROT13 to C. it's doesn't look all that efficient, but hey! it's my first time writing this kind of code in C.PS: i like this kind of study! doing things like a crash course.

3. [Worlds Shortest C Implementation of ROT13](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/rot13.html)<br>
as i was doing the classic GSGS about it, i found this page which shows the SHORTEST IMPLEMENTATION OF ROT13 and as i was scrolling down, it could be written in a single FRICKIN LINE! i felt so stupid but also AMAZED at what can people do!

4. [C for Java Programmers](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ferguson/csc/c/c-for-java-programmers.pdf)<br>
it says in the slides that i have to reference some C language Tutorial. And because im a Java programmer it's best for me just to find some tutorials about learning C WHILE i already understand Java so i can immediately go into the Advanced there and had a headstart.

5. [ILOVEYOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soZyb6lMx4c)<br>
As we are talking about Security Problems, this week's material also talked about viruses. and the one thing that comes to mind is "What is the most dangerous virus ever created" i remember that one video i saw that lists some notorious viruses like MYDOOM, ILOVEYOU, and that one Worm i forgot the name is. And i found this video (it's pretty new and pretty interesting) that documents one of the most deadly computer virus named ILOVEYOU made by the same guy who made the video about MYDOOM.

6. [Why Linux is More Safe Than Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJnrsGqyw3U)<br>
One of the reasons i used linux more than windows is because most of the virus being made mostly for macOS and windows. secondly, there's no programs that is made that i usually use in linux that requires some intrusive access to my machine.

7. [DDoS attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I4O4hoKzb8)<br>
I know DDOS is denial of service attack. i don't know how it actually works so Linus will take it away!

8. [Some Surprising Stuff!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMScV1Mkaok)<br>
Everybody and their mom says to use a VPN to protect my privacy against hackers and stuff. And suddenly BOOM that meme NordVPN got hacked and breached all their user's privacy so that checks out that users doesn't actually protect much of their privacy by only hiding their traffic through some server.

9. [COMMON SENSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzeKPiwEfXk)<br>
On the past days i used external antiviruses for my system because i thought that was the thing essential to my protection but turns out it just slows my system. Windows has already had a good virus protection in and of itself it freakin called WINDOWS SECURITY, it's already has what you needed and doesn't slow your system. I trust myself in preventing a virus from smashing my computer just by avoiding illegitimate websites and links.

10. [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)<br>
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distro geared towards cyber security. it has already pre-installed a lot of programs/apps needed to start testing security.
