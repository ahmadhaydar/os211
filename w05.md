# Top 10 most interesing Links of Week 05

1. [What is virtual memory? â€“ Gary explains](youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
Before virtual reality and virtual currency there was virtual memory. Windows has it, iOS has it and so does Android. What is it and how does it work? i use this link for me to speedrunning studying about virtual memory. like my previous list, i exclaim that i like to use videos for me to study because it's more interesting that way, but the video had to be simple and to the point, not boring to the point that it's an asmr video.

2. [Tuesday Tech Tip - The State of Copy-On-Write File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8Tq-uHX_c)<br>
this video talks about the state of copy-on-write file systems in RHEL/CentOS Linux. Over the last few months, they have been preparing our infrastructure to transition from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8. With this change, they noticed that there was a complete omission of btrfs BUT there was an also an upgrade of XFS with some new copy-on-write style features.

3. [What is a Paging File or Pagefile as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br>
A paging file is an overflow for your RAM or system memory. This video explains what that means and how to optimize it. I already gave this video from the last week where i talk about the same topic, turns out iz pretty much similar so i put this in too.

4. [Linux programming in C- fork()](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/5297927/Linux-programming-in-C-fork)<br>
this link contains an example on how people use fork() in linux programming in C. the example is a program that creates a child process using fork. Each of the parent and the child should execute a loop, causing it to sleep for 1 second, wake up and display its pid and say whether it is the parent or the child and also display its parent's pid.

5. [FIFO Page Replacement](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/fifo-page-replacement)<br>
In my time in quiz i use this page as a reference for me to finish my stuff. it contain's a page that would explain First-in, first-out (FIFO) as the simplest among page replacement algorithms.

6. [Different Kinds of Memory as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZcszUj5szA)<br>
DRAM, SRAM, cache, NAND, flash... So many words, and all of them mean memory, but there are some big differences between them! this link contains a video from TechQuickie (the same as "What is paging file As fast as possible") that will explain Different Kinds of Memory as Fast As Possible and what it's for. 

7. [Copy on Write goes Moo](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
Copy on Write or simply COW is a resource management technique. One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS. this link will explain about Copy on Write, the idea and it's uses in UNIX like OS.

8. [Thrashing in Operating System](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os)<br>
When a program need space larger than RAM or it need space when RAM is full, Operating System will try to allocate space from secondary memory and behaves like it has that much amount of memory by serving to that program. This concept is called virtual memory. To know about thrashing we first need to know what is page fault and swapping. this link explains what is Thrashing in the OS and the techniques to handle them.

9. [How computer memory works - Kanawat Senanan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4)<br>
In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role. Kanawat Senanan explains how computer memory works. I like this video because it uses more visual cues and how compact the explanation is.

10. [Minecraft Clone in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2axRaIQxVU)<br>
this guy makes a whole minecraft clone using C, more of a using his own game engine written in C. it's pretty impressive that this guy written all of this in a language that in my opinion, is not easy to learn. well that sentences pretty much sums up why i show this link.
